# debugging-practice-express

### Running tests 

Tests can be run after installing dependencies with ``` npm test ``` 

--- 

### What this project was about

For this project I was given a codebase with at least 6 (intentionally written) bugs in it for me to find, test, and fix. 

--- 

### What I did 

Debugging is definitely an exercise in understanding what the code is really doing. I used function docstrings as a single source of truth when deciding if the components were working together as intended, and made use of extensive testing (Jest) to check for errors in the codebase given to me. Though the tests I was initially given did pass, many of them did not set proper expectations. 

When I found an issue, I would 
1. Document the bug
2. Fix the bug with a corresponding numbered comment
3. Add a test case that passes with the fix 

--- 

### What I learned 

Writing tests is not the thing, unless you are testing the right stuff. It's important to understand the data you are interacting with, and how the components and functions interact with one another. It's important to not just make use of the tools available, but really understand how they work.

### Looking forward 

This project has given me a passion for minding the details in code. As I further broaden my knowledge and deepen my understanding of how different systems work together, I would love more opporutunities to iterate on my own code (and eventually that of my peers)
